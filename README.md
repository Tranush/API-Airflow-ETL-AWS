# API-Airflow-ETL-AWS
Feeling a bit puzzled about how APIs work or the intricacies of hosting applications like Apache Airflow on AWS & functionality of AWS S3? Look no further! I'm thrilled to share my recent project journey with you, tailored specifically for those seeking clarity in these areas.

Excited to unveil this beginner project to all those people who want to begin journey in #DataEngineering and learn about APIs, JSON handling, and Airflow workflow construction using Python, culminating in hosting Airflow on an AWS EC2 server! ðŸš€

In this project, I embarked on exploring the OpenWeather API to extract weather data for specific cities and seamlessly integrated within Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for data transformation.

Through this hands-on experience, I've not only mastered the intricacies of API integration but also gained a deep understanding of Airflow's capabilities and the nuances of hosting Airflow applications on AWS EC2. Additionally, I acquired insights into efficiently storing files in Amazon S3 buckets directly from Airflow.
